ABOUT

PowerBayes is a free software package for learning the structure of Bayesian Networks.

The package contains implementations of the algorithms described in:

Andrew Fast, Learning the Structure of Bayesian Networks with Constraint Satisfaction, Ph.D. Thesis, University of Massachusetts Amherst, 2009

USAGE

See kdl.bayes.experiments.RunAlgorithm.java for instructions on running algorithms implemented in this package.

The package assumes that data in Weka's ARFF format is available for each network in the following format:

<path>/<dataname>/<dataname>.train.<index>.<sampleSize>

and

<path>/<dataname>/<dataname>.test.<index>.<sampleSize>

where <path>, <dataname>, <index> and <sampleSize> are supplied as runtime arguments to RunAlgorithm.java.

The PC-CMH algorithm requires a working installation of the R statistical environment in order to use the JRI interface.  Other algorithms should work properly without R installed.
