sam -- paper combines fave things: nonparametric bayesian + structure learning
- doesnt formulate s.l. as finding THE strcuture via constraints or score 

Emma: is structure more than topology?

David
- structure -- topology (existene and direction of edges
-- relation is an overloaded term, esp in KDL -- some contexts it means an edge in a DGM -- in other cases, it means FO relationship between entity classes (e.g. person X is friend of person Y) -- relationship in relational learning we use as a constraints over possible deps between variables of entities
e.g. e.g. variable political views as a variable that...between friends; bayes nets...


Sam: talk about algorithm
- imagine strong prior over strcture 
e.g. disease/symptom -- can explicity encode a strong prior between edges between diseas part and symptom part
- using CRP is revealing -- mixture of nodes...class asignment dictates prior probabilities over edges in final structure


david: discuss CRP
sam: discussion of difinettis theorem, exchangable process, learning hyperparameters
david: under difinettis theorem, is NOTHING i.i.d.?
sam: difinettis thm says we can make this iid by conditioning on the parameter
