Much has been written in recent weeks about Cambridge Analytica's exploitation of Facebook data and the role that Facebook may or may not have played in the 2016 election. If headlines are to be believed, we are reaching mass hysteria about the role that fake news, ad auctions, user data, and experimentation play in our every day lives. However, the statistical truth of the matter is that we, as a society, just don't know the effect of online manpulation yet. Furthermore, conflating manpulation to achieve and end goal (fake news, nefarious marketing, gaming Google search) with intervention designed to tease out cause and effect (online experiments) is itself a dangerous view that erroneously maligns one of the best tools we have for actually understanding our increasingly virtual society.


Experimentation is one of the most powerful tools we have at our disposal, as humans, to make sense of the world. It is the gold-standard for understanding cause and effect. It is integral to the scientific method and innate to the human experience. Although experimentation mainly falls under the academic purview of methodology, its place in the taxonomy of academic studies belies the truly moral, human, and subjective aspects of experimentation. Contemporary discussion discussion of experimentation, at least in the authors' experience, include both the admiring and ethical (Jenner's development of a smallpox vaccine, Mendel's development of inheritance), as well as the cautionary and deplorable (Mengele's twin "studies," the U.S. government's Tuskeegee syphillis experiment). Modern scientific training always includes a discussion of ethics and responsibility.

What we the authors worry about, in the context of recent events, is a reactionary view of experimentation in the online setting. One of the challenges to regulating online experiments is that there are still many things we don't understand about how people's virtual lives impact their offline lives. Prominent researchers such as Fernando Diaz have pointed out that large Internet firms vying for users' attention need to consider *how* their services are being used. Diaz's examples include the ethics of running experiments on search engines when users are searching for emergency services during a natural disaster. SCOTUS is currently presiding over a case between crisis pregnancy centers and the state of California; the former has been accussed of, among other things, false advertising of medical services, using Google search features to redirect women to facilities that may not be liecenced and may not even have trained medical staff.

It is highly unlikely that any of these ethical issues were in the minds of any of the creators of Facebook, Google search, Bing, etc. We the authors have no idea whether any of these ethical issues have merit or have impacted people's lives. What we do know is that testing whether an online system causes some kind of effect can only really be done via experimentation. These systems are so complex, we do not stand a chance of adequately modelling them or diagnosing problems within them from statistical information alone.

# Disclosure of experimental results
We believe in the legitimacy and necessity of online experimentation. One of our main concerns is that current public opinion regarding online experimentation will lead firms to keep experimentation in-house and not share their findings. We do not believe it is practical, let alone productive, to regulate experimentation at private firms in the manner that experimentation is regulated at academic institutions, research labs, etc. One may make the argument that firms such as Facebook ought to be public utilties as they absorb responsibilities typically associated with the state. However, that is a thought experiment for another blog post.

Assuming that things continue roughly as currently are, we believe in the need to encourage the public disclosure of experimental results. Nearly every online firm conducts regularly conducts experiments. Many of these experiments may be regarded as trivial (e.g., red or blue button colors). No one can say how many are nontrivial, since few firms actually publish their results. It is important to encourage firms to publish their results; so long as negative reporting and sensationalist headlines shape public opinion regarding experimentation, most firms will be resistant to doing so.

Note that we say disclosure, rather than transparency, because many hypotheses are not testable under full transparency.

# When done responsibly, experimentation is the ethical choice
We have emphasized the complexity of online systems such as Google and Facebook, focusing on how much of what makes them work, what makes them attract users, is not understood. Assuming that these web properties continue to function largely as-is, it would be irresponsible to *not* conduct experiments on them, since as we have argued, experimentation is the only way we can come to understand specific properties of a complex system. Furthermore, unlike outside agents, these firms are in the unique position of being able to directly combat bad actors.

One argument that could be made is: if X doesn't do it, Y will. This is both compelling and disappointing. We should not be motivated by the ill intentions of less scrupulous agents. Rather, experimentation ought to come from a desire to understand.

# Changing how we think about experimentation
Finally, the authors would like to challenge the reader to think about online experimentation more as a mechanism for testing assumptions than the tool of amoral mad scientists. Consider recent work investigating racial bias in machine-learned online advertising models: the passive collection of data has led to a system that researchers do not fully understand.
