<h1> Relational Causal Discovery </h1>
<p> </p>

Relational Causal Discovery (RCD) is a sound and complete algorithm for learning causal models from relational data.  RCD employs a novel rule, called relational bivariate orientation, that can can detect the orientation of a bivariate dependency with no assumptions on the underlying distribution.  Combined with relational extensions to the rules utilized by the PC algorithm[1], RCD is provably sound and complete under the causal sufficiency assumption.  Given a database and schema, RCD outputs a partially directed model that represents the equivalence class of statistically indistinguishable relational causal models.

RCD is designed and implemented by the [Knowledge Discovery Laboratory](https://kdl.cs.umass.edu) in the [College of Information and Computer Sciences](https://www.cics.umass.edu/) at the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://umass.edu). See “A Sound and Complete Algorithm for Learning Causal Models from Relational Data” (Maier, et al., UAI 2013)  for additional information on RCD.
