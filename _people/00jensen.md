I am a faculty member in the College of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.  I direct the Knowledge Discovery Laboratory, which I founded in 2000.  I also serve as the Associate Director of the Computational Social Science Institute, an interdisciplinary effort at UMass to study social phenomena using computational tools and concepts.  From 1991 to 1995, I served as an analyst with the Office of Technology Assessment, an agency of the United States Congress.  I received my doctoral degree from Washington University in St. Louis in 1992.

My current research focuses on machine learning and data science for analyzing large social, technological, and computational systems.  In particular, my work focuses on methods for constructing accurate causal models from observational and experimental data, with applications to social science, fraud detection, security, and systems management.  My research is supported by many organizations, including the National Science Foundation, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity.
