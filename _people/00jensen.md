He also serves as the Associate Director of the Computational Social Science Institute, an interdisciplinary effort at UMass to study social phenomena using computational tools and concepts.  From 1991 to 1995, he served as an analyst with the Office of Technology Assessment, an agency of the United States Congress.  He received is D.Sc. from Washington University in St. Louis in 1992.

Jensen's current research focuses on machine learning and data science for analyzing large social, technological, and computational systems.  In particular, his work focuses on methods for constructing accurate causal models from observational and experimental data, with applications to explainable AI, social science, fraud detection, security, and systems management.
