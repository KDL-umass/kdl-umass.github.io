Sam Witty is a third year MS/PhD student in CICS. His research focus is on bridging the gap between mechanistic and machine learning models, with applications in AI-assisted scientific discovery and explainable AI. Before joining the Knowledge Discovery Lab, Sam spent three years as an energy efficiency policy consultant, where he led efforts in experimental design, statistical analysis, simulation modeling, and machine learning. When he's not working you're likely to find him lost in the woods with his puppy Mira.
