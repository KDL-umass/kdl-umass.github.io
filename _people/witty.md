Sam Witty is a second year MS/PhD student in Computer Science at UMass, Amherst, where he works on bridging the gap between machine learning and causal inference to accelerate scientific discovery and inform decision making. In particular, his research focusses on explainable artificial intelligence, probabilistic programming, and algorithmic fairness. Before joining the Knowledge Discovery Lab, Sam spent three years as an energy efficiency policy consultant, where he led efforts in experimental design, statistical analysis, simulation modeling, and machine learning. In the rare moments when he’s not reading/writing/talking about data you’re likely to find him climbing a pile of rocks or lost in the woods with his puppy Mira.
