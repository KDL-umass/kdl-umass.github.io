Sam Witty is a third year MS/PhD student of Computer Science at UMass Amherst, where he uses experimental design and causal inference methods to explain the behaviour of complex AI systems. Before joining the Knowledge Discovery Lab, Sam spent three years as an energy efficiency policy consultant, where he led efforts in experimental design, statistical analysis, simulation modeling, and machine learning. In the rare moments when he’s not reading/writing/talking about data you’re likely to find him lost in the woods with his puppy Mira.
