Kaleigh is a PhD candidate at CICS interested in causal inference and experimental design, particularly when traditional assumptions about the underlying data are not met. She focuses on applications in computational social science and those related to fairness, accountability, transparency, and ethics in machine learning. When she wants to kick back and enjoy life, she pursues interest in table top games, dinos, and diving for lost treasure.
