I am a Senior Research Scientist working in the area of collaborating-software systems.

I am exploring issues in combining software systems and individuals to form effective collaborating processes and organizations. I am particularly interested in complex, dynamic settings where people and advanced software entities work together in structured, yet highly adaptable, ways.
