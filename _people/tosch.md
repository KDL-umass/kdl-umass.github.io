Emma is a PhD candidate in CICS, hoping to defend in the next year. She is currently working on the DARPA XAI projects, building infrastructure to facilitate answering questions pertaining to explainability. Emma's research interests lead to questions about the expressibility and correctness of data science infrastructure problems. Her dissertation work lies at the intersection of programming language design and experimental design. Emma enjoys trail running, the annual St. Patrick's Day Holyoke Road Race, and cycling in all its incarnations.
