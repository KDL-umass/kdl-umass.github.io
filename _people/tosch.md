Emma is a PhD candidate in CICS, currently trying her hand at teaching a large introductory course to discrete probabilistic modeling. Emma's research interests lead to questions about the expressibility and correctness of data science infrastructure problems. Her dissertation work lies at the intersection of programming language design and experimental design. Emma enjoys trail running, the annual St. Patrick's Day Holyoke Road Race, and cycling in all its incarnations.
